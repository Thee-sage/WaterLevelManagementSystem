# Automatic Water Level Sensor

## Introduction

This project presents an IoT-based water level monitoring system using the ESP8266 microcontroller, ultrasonic sensors, and the arduino platform. It provides real-time monitoring, remote accessibility, and automated alerts. This cost-effective solution is ideal for improving water management and agricultural practices in rural areas.

## System Architecture and Components

### 1. ESP8266 Microcontroller
The ESP8266 microcontroller is used to interface with the JSN-SR04T ultrasonic sensor. Key connections:
- **D0**: Trigger pin for the ultrasonic sensor.
- **D1**: Echo pin for the ultrasonic sensor.
- **VIN**: Provides 5V power to the sensor.
- **GND**: Ground connection.

### 2. Ultrasonic Sensors
The JSN-SR04T ultrasonic sensor operates by transmitting ultrasonic pulses and measuring the time it takes for the pulses to return after reflecting off an object. This time delay is used to calculate the distance to the object.

### Component Connections
- **TRIG (Trigger) pin** of JSN-SR04T to GPIO pin D0 on ESP8266.
- **ECHO pin** of JSN-SR04T to GPIO pin D1 on ESP8266.
